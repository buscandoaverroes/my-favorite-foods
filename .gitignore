# Start by ignoring everything, and below we are explicitly saying
# what to not ignore
*

# exclude data from source control by default
/data/

#######################
# List of files with GitHub functionality anywhere in the repo
# that we do not want to ignore

# These files include GitHub settings
!.gitignore

!.gitkeep

# Keep markdown + documentation files
!README.md
!CONTRIBUTING.md
!LICENSE*

#######################
# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.

#######################
# The following file types are code that should always be
# included no matter where in the repository folder they are
# located unless you explicitly ignore that folder

# R
!/**/*.R
!/**/*.Rmd
!renv.lock

# LaTeX
!/**/*.tex
!/**/*.bib

# Python
!/**/*.py
!/**/*.ipynb
# Still ignore .ipynb files in checkpoint folders
.ipynb_checkpoints

# Markdown
!/**/*.md

# Julia
!/**/*.jl

#######################
# Include some additional file formats in any output folder. You might have
# to change the name of the Output folder to whatever it is called in your
# project, but we strongly recommend that you only include these files in
# a subset of the folders where you are certain no private data is ever stored.
!/visuals/png/*.png

#######################
# Include all the files with passwords or tokens here. All files named
# password or passwords are with this template ignored no matter which
# format you are using. Additionally, all content in any folder called
# password or passwords are also ignored. NOTE that your project might be
# using different names and then you must edit the lines below accordingly.

.Rproj.user
!/**/*.Rproj
